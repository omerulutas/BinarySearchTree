# Binary Search Tree

This study is containing data structure's Binary Search Tree topic with illustration and implementation . Project is implemented in Java. I implement in my university life.

## A brief review of the binary search tree

An important application of binary trees is to use them in search operations. The binary search tree is a binary tree in which each parent node contains a data value that provides the following:

- all data values in the left subnet are smaller than the data value in the parent node
- The data value in the parent node is smaller than all values in the right subnet.
- the left and right sub trees are also binary search trees.
